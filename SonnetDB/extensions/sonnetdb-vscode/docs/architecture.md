# Architecture Notes

## 1. Runtime model

The extension should have three layers:

1. VS Code host layer
   - commands
   - tree views
   - webview panels
   - secret storage
2. SonnetDB transport layer
   - HTTP client
   - NDJSON parser
   - Copilot SSE client
3. Optional managed local runtime
   - start and stop a local SonnetDB server process
   - point that server at a selected data root

## 2. Why remote-first

Remote-first is the fastest production path because SonnetDB already exposes the required server contracts:

- list databases
- fetch schema
- execute SQL
- ingest bulk payloads
- stream Copilot events
- expose MCP endpoints

That means the extension can ship useful database features without inventing a new transport.

## 3. Why not start with SonnetDB.Data inside VS Code

Using `SonnetDB.Data` directly inside the extension host would require:

- a .NET sidecar process or native bridge
- process lifecycle management
- IPC or stdio protocol work
- platform packaging complexity

That path is still useful later, especially for language services, but it should not block the first extension release.

## 4. Local mode direction

The preferred local-mode design is:

- user picks a local SonnetDB data root
- extension starts a managed SonnetDB server process
- extension connects to that local server through the same HTTP client used for remote mode

Benefits:

- one transport model
- reuse of existing auth, schema, SQL, and Copilot endpoints
- lower implementation risk

## 5. UI surfaces

Recommended VS Code surfaces:

- activity bar container: explorer tree and connection actions
- command palette: add connection, run query, open result panel, open Copilot
- custom result webview: table, raw JSON, chart
- optional future notebook: query workbook for demos and onboarding
- optional future chat participant: SonnetDB-aware assistant entry

## 6. Security model

- connection metadata can live in extension global state
- tokens should live in VS Code `SecretStorage`
- Copilot defaults to `read-only`
- `read-write` Copilot mode should require explicit user action

## 7. Testing strategy

- unit tests for NDJSON parsing and endpoint payload normalization
- integration tests against a local SonnetDB server process
- smoke tests for explorer tree loading and query execution
- later: VS Code extension tests for command registration and webview rendering
